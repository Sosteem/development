In dart there is no keyword interface but you can use class or abstract class to declare an interface.
All classes implicitly define an interface. Mostly abstract class is used to declare an interface.

You must use the implements keyword to implement an interface. The class that implements an interface must implement all the methods and properties of the interface.


Note: Most of the time, abstract class is used instead of concrete class to declare an interface.
