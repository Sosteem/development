Mixins are declared using the keyword mixin followed by the mixin name.
Three keywords are used while working with mixins: mixin, with, and on. It is possible to use multiple mixins in a class.



The with keyword is used to apply the mixin to the class. It promotes DRY(Don’t Repeat Yourself) principle.
