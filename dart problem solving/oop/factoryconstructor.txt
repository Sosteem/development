Factory Constructor In Dart
all the constructor we have studied until now is generative constructor.Dart also provides a special type of constructor called factory constructor.
A factory constructor gives more flexibility to create an object. Generative constructors only create an instance of the class. 
But, the factory constructor can return an instance of the class or even subclass.
 It is also used to return the cached instance of the class.



 Rules For Factory Constructors
 Factory constructor must return an instance of the class or sub-class.
 You can’t use this keyword inside factory constructor.
 It can be named or unnamed and called like normal constructor.
 It can’t access instance members of the class.

 Note: An initializer list allows you to assign properties to a new instance variable before the constructor body runs, but after creation.
